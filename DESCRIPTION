Description: The Climate Prediction Center's (CPC) rainfall data for the
    world (1979 to present, 50 km resolution) and the USA (1948 to
    present, 25 km resolution), is one of the few high quality, long
    term, observation based, daily rainfall products available for free.
    Although raw data is available at CPC's ftp site, obtaining,
    processing and visualizing the data is not straightforward. There are
    thousands of files, and file formats and file extensions have been 
    changing over time. This package provides functionality to download, 
    process and visualize over 40 years of global rainfall data and over 
    70 years of USA rainfall data from CPC.
